# Security and Contributing Guidelines

## üîí Security Practices

We take security seriously in this project. Please follow these guidelines when working with the repo:

* **Secrets Management**

  * Do **not** commit `.env` files, service account keys, or credentials to git.
  * All secrets are ignored via `.gitignore` (`.env`, `keys/`, `airflow/keys/`).
  * Use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

* **Service Accounts & IAM**

  * Service accounts should be created with **least privilege** roles.
  * Example roles required:

    * `roles/storage.admin`
    * `roles/aiplatform.admin`
    * `roles/artifactregistry.admin`
    * `roles/run.admin`

* **Dependency Security**

  * Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt` and environment-specific files (`requirements-dev.txt`, etc.).
  * Run `pip install --upgrade` cautiously and re-test before committing changes.

* **Vulnerability Reporting**

  * If you discover a security issue, **do not open a public GitHub issue**.
  * Instead, contact the maintainers directly at:
    üìß **\[[your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com)]**
