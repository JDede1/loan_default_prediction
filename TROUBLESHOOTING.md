## üõ† Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes when running the pipeline:


### 1. **Serve container fails with `RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST`**

**Error:**

```
mlflow.exceptions.RestException: RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST: Registered Model with name=loan_default_model not found
```

**Cause:** Serving container started **before** a model exists in the MLflow Registry.

**Fix:**

1. Start core services: `make start`
2. Train a model via Airflow DAG `train_pipeline_dag`
3. Confirm in MLflow UI ‚Üí *Models* ‚Üí `loan_default_model`
4. Start serving: `make start-serve` (health: `curl -sS http://localhost:5001/ping`)


### 2. **Permission denied writing artifacts (plots, reports)**

**Error in Airflow logs:**

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Permission denied writing /opt/airflow/artifacts/feature_importance.png
```

**Cause:** Container doesn‚Äôt have write permissions on mounted `artifacts/`.

**Fix:**

* Run `make troubleshoot` (resets ownership and perms).
* Or, inside Codespaces:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 artifacts/ airflow/artifacts/ airflow/logs/ mlruns/
```


### 3. **GCS access errors (403 / denied)**

**Error:**

```
google.api_core.exceptions.Forbidden: 403 ... does not have storage.objects.get access
```

**Fix:**

* Ensure your service account has IAM:

  * `roles/storage.objectAdmin` (read/write)
  * Or minimally `roles/storage.objectViewer` (read-only)
* Verify key is mounted correctly:
  `keys/gcs-service-account.json` ‚Üí `/opt/airflow/keys/gcs-service-account.json`



### 4. **Airflow webserver won‚Äôt start (healthcheck fails)**

**Fix:**

* Run `make troubleshoot` to tail logs.
* Ensure no stale PID files:

```bash
rm -f airflow/airflow-webserver.pid airflow/airflow-scheduler.pid
```

* Rebuild clean:

```bash
make stop
make start --fresh
```


### 5. **Integration tests fail in CI but pass locally**

**Cause:** CI may start `serve` before model exists.

**Fix:**

* Restrict CI to lint + unit tests (`ci.yml`).
* Run integration only on demand (`ci-integration.yml`).
* Locally, run:

```bash
make start
# train via Airflow
make start-serve
make integration-tests
```


### 6. **Git LFS blocking pushes**

**Error:**

```
This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path
```

**Fix:**

* Install git-lfs inside Codespaces (already automated in `.devcontainer`).
* Or disable LFS hooks if not using LFS:

```bash
rm -f .git/hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/post-commit
```


üîë **Tip:** When in doubt, run:

```bash
make troubleshoot
docker compose -f airflow/docker-compose.yaml logs -f
```
This will surface most container-level issues.


### 7) ‚ÄúDocker-in-Docker‚Äù feature fails in Codespaces

**Why**
Codespaces already provides Docker‚Äîno need for DinD.

**Fix**

* Ensure `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` does **not** include `docker-in-docker` feature.
* Use the provided devcontainer that installs `gcloud`, Terraform, and `git-lfs` only.
